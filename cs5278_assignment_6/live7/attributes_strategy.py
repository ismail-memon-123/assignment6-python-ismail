        Given a data item of type T, returns

        An attribute can be thought of as a key/value pair that is
        associated with the data. Each attribute has a name, type, and value.

        Another way of thinking of attribute is that they represent
        "columns" and the data items are "rows" in a database.
        Since the type of the data items in our database can vary,
        we need a helper class (e.g., strategy) to extract the
        columns present in a data item.
